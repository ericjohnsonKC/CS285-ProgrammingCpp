/*
    Create a simple Employee class with name, 
    department, and title.  

    Create an hourlyEmployee class (which inherits 
    from the Employee class) for a basic payroll 
    program to compute the net pay salary of hourly 
    based employees. Your program should also find 
    the average net pay for a small company. To 
    define the class, include the 
    appropriate data members, member functions, 
    constructors, and access modifiers. For simplicity, 
    use a constant tax rate of 30% to compute the tax 
    amount. Employees that work over 40 hours will 
    receive overtime pay of one and a half of their 
    hourly rate for overtime hours worked. The output 
    should display the name of each employee, hours 
    worked, hourly rate, overtime pay, regular (gross) 
    pay, tax amount, and net pay.

    Create a salariedEmployee class (which inherits from 
    the Employee class) which hold the annual salary of 
    the employee. To define the class, include the 
    appropriate data members, member functions, 
    constructors, and access modifiers. Figure weekly pay 
    by dividing the annual salary by 52. The output for 
    the salaried employee should display the name, gross 
    pay, tax amount (compute at 30%), and net pay.

    Write a test program with an array of 6 payroll objects: 
    3 hourlyEmployee objects and 3 salariedEmployee objects. 
    The data for the 6 objects should be “hard coded” into 
    the program.

    Submit all files within one ZIP file. You must submit 
    source code, a screenshot with time stamp of code 
    execution, and a text file of the code. All code should 
    include comments. Be sure to include your name, date, 
    and assignment title in the comments at the top of each 
    file.
